# React RTK Query Search Products with DummyJSON
This project is a React App that interacts with DummyJSON, an external API, to fetch products and their categories.

## Features

### Advanced State Management
- Uses Context API for theme appearance management.
- Uses Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for managing the products from the DummyJSON API.

### Component Composition
- Components are modularly organized and named according to their responsibilities and intended uses.
- Architecture promotes scalability and reusability across different parts of the application.

### Reusable Design Patterns
- Employs reusable design patterns for product item listing to improve the development footwork and ensure consistency.

## Requirements
- **Internet Connection**: Required for accessing the DummyJSON API at `https://dummyjson.com`. Ensure network settings allow outgoing requests to this URL.
- **Node.js**: Version 14+ recommended for compatibility with the application code.
